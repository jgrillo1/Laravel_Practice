# Laravel_Practice
This project will be used to demonstrate how amazing Laravel is and how effortless it makes programming dynamic systems such as web pages.
Included will be some php files as well as some mysql tables.
This project uses VM Virtualbox as well as Vagrant. 
So far completed tutorials 1,2, and 4 of Laravel 5.4 From Scratch
Was not able to share files with virtualbox as easily as I had hoped. Still need to look into the sharedfolders between host and guest machines. 
Therefore not all the necessary files from the package are included in this repo yet.
Files included are all files discussed or modified during the completed tutorials. Note: I was not able to extract these files either. I typed them by hand to get the repo started.
